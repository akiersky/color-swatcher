# Color Swatcher

A Sketch plugin to analyze document colors and show the WCAG color contrast value. 

Usage:
1. Select one or multiple color rectangles in your document and run the plugin
2. A swatch will be generated showing the color value, and contrasts against white and black.

If no color is selected, the plugin will generate swatches for each layer style in the document.

This is my first Skech plugin, any feedback is appreciated!
